# Git Portable

Git Portable is the Git version control system packaged with a PortableApps.com
launcher as a portable app, so you can use Git on your iPod, USB flash drive,
portable hard drive, etc. It has all the same features as Git, plus, it leaves
no personal information behind on the machine you run it on, so you can take it
with you wherever you go.
